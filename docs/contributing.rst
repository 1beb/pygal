Github
======

Submit your bug reports and feature requests to the `github bug tracker <http://github.com/Kozea/pygal/issues>`_.


Testing
=======

Before submiting a pull request, please check that all tests still pass.


To do this install ``py.test`` and them run ``py.test`` in the root of your pygal clone:

.. code-block:: bash

   [dev@dev pygal/]$ py.test


Even better if you have several python versions installed you can run ``tox``.
